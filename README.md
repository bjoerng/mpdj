# mpdj - A graph based DJ-like playlist generator auto enqueue thingy for mpd

This project aims to create a playlist generator/auto enqueue songs thingy for
 Music Player Daemon. Just fire up mpdj_builder.py. Add some selection with
 criterias and provide some connections between them. mpdj_runner.py will
 traverse your selections and will add songs, matching the collection
 criterias to your mpd playlist.

Have fun and let me know if you have any ideas for this thing.
