# mpdj - A graph based DJ-like playlist generator auto enqueue thingy for mpd

This project aims to create a playlist generator/auto enqueue thingy for
for Music Player Daemon. Just fire up mpdj_builder.py. Add some selection
and create some connections between them. mpdj will traverse your
selections and will add song, matched by the collection to your mpd
playlist.

Have fun and let me know if you have any ideas for this thing.
